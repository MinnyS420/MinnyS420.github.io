## Projects 

I have been working on a variety of projects over the past few months. Here are some of the highlights:

## Project1 --- Calculator

This code is setting up a calculator. It defines variables to store the previous and current operands, an operation, and functions to clear, delete numbers, handle operations, perform operations, input numbers, and update the display. It also adds event listeners to each button so that when clicked it will call the appropriate function.

## Project2 --- Swapi Api App

This code is a JavaScript program that fetches data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and renders it to the DOM. It stores the data in sessionStorage to avoid unnecessary requests. When a button is clicked, it fetches more detailed information about the element and displays it in a list. The program also sets up event listeners for each of the buttons that make requests to different endpoints of the SWAPI.

## Project3 --- Weather App

This code initializes a weather app. It imports helper functions from other files, sets up API parameters, and stores DOM elements in variables. It then defines a function that fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and sets the city name and weather data in the DOM. The code also adds event listeners to the location search button, hourly button, and daily button to call the initializeWeatherApp() function with different parameters. Finally, it calls initializeWeatherApp() with a parameter of true to initialize the weather app with local data.
